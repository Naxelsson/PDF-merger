# PDF-merger
PDF_merger.py- Combines all PDF files in the current working directory (starting with a certain letter combination) into a single PDF.
There is an option to exclude and include  the first and/or last x pages in each file. Note that the output file might need to be opened in Chrome or Firefox and then downloaded again to work properly.
